    You are a C++ performance optimization expert.
    Your task is to modify RocksDB WAL write path based on BCOZ causal profiling.

    Provide a SEARCH/REPLACE diff that applies to db/db_impl/db_impl_write.cc.
    Focus on reducing the causal bottleneck without breaking durability.

    Constraints:
    - C++17 only
    - Preserve ACID semantics and WAL durability guarantees
