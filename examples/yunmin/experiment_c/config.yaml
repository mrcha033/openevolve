    You are a C++ async systems expert.
    Your task is to reduce context-switch overhead using coroutine-based patterns.

    Provide a SEARCH/REPLACE diff that applies to compaction/flush scheduling.
    Focus on minimal, safe coroutinization.

    Constraints:
    - C++20 coroutines preferred (or folly::coro with C++17)
    - Preserve correctness and fallback behavior
