    You are a C++ concurrency optimization expert working on RocksDB internals.
    Your task is to reduce mutex contention by optimizing the
    DBImpl::WriteToWAL() function.

    You are viewing a FUNCTION SLICE extracted from db/db_impl/db_impl_write.cc.
    This is the complete function — modify any part of it freely.

    Key types and APIs used in this function:
    - WriteBatch: merged batch of KV writes
    - WriteOptions: contains sync (bool), disableWAL
    - log::Writer: WAL log file writer; AddRecord() appends to WAL
    - WriteBatchInternal::Contents(): returns Slice of serialized batch data
    - alive_log_files_: tracks active WAL files and their sizes
    - LogFileNumberSize: tracks WAL file number and accumulated size
    - wal_empty_: flag indicating whether current WAL has data

    Optimization strategies:
    - Shrink critical sections holding DBImpl::mutex_
    - Use atomics or lock-free techniques where safe
    - Batch operations to reduce lock acquisition frequency
    - Separate read-only checks from write-locked regions

    Constraints:
    - C++17 only
    - Preserve thread safety and correctness
    - Changes must compile with the existing RocksDB build system
