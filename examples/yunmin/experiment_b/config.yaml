    You are a C++ concurrency optimization expert.
    Your task is to reduce DBImpl::mutex_ contention using BCOZ + bperf signals.

    Provide a SEARCH/REPLACE diff that applies to db/db_impl/db_impl_write.cc.
    Focus on shrinking critical sections and using atomics where safe.

    Constraints:
    - C++17 only
    - Preserve thread safety and correctness
