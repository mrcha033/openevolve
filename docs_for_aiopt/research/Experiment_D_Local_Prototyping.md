# Experiment D: Local Prototyping

**Status:** ARCHIVED — Superseded by task redesign (2026-02-08)

This document described a local RocksDB-Lite prototyping path. It is no longer applicable after the pivot away from RocksDB kernel mutation toward self-contained program optimization.

See `AIOpt_Proposal.md` for the current experiment design.
See `AIOpt_Critical_Review.md` for why the RocksDB approach was abandoned.
