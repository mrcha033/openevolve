# PIM-Fusion Optimization Report

## Project: Semantic Kernel Fusion for Hardware Acceleration
**Target:** OpenEvolve/examples/yunmin/pim-fusion/
**Date:** 2026-02-02

## 1. Bottleneck Analysis (BPerf Simulation)
Using a simulated performance model (BPerf equivalent), we identified that data movement between the CPU and Memory Controller accounts for approximately **95%** of the total execution latency in unfused semantic kernels.
- **Memory Latency:** 100ns per access
- **Compute Latency:** 10ns per operation

In the baseline scenario (Linear -> ReLU -> Linear), each operation performs a separate memory read and write, leading to redundant off-chip traffic.

## 2. Optimization Strategy: Kernel Fusion
We implemented a fusion mutation that targets custom PIM instructions. By fusing the activation function and the subsequent linear layer into a single PIM kernel, we minimize the "Memory Controller Wait Time".

### Mutation Details:
- **Baseline:** `[Read A] -> [Compute Op1] -> [Write B] -> [Read B] -> [Compute Op2] -> [Write C]`
- **Fused:** `[Read A] -> [Compute Op1] -> [Compute Op2] -> [Write C]`

## 3. Results
Simulation results for 1,000,000 elements:
- **Baseline Time:** 0.420s
- **Fused Time:** 0.220s
- **Performance Gain:** **47.62% reduction** in total latency.

## 4. Conclusion
Fusing semantic kernels for PIM-enabled hardware significantly reduces the data movement bottleneck. This optimization is critical for off-CPU acceleration where memory bandwidth and latency are the primary constraints.
